I love coffee! For all of you coffee lovers out there, this story might sound familiar: on a hectic day, you finally get a break and stop by Starbucks to energize yourself with your favorite beverage. Whether it’s a smooth latte or a refreshing Frappuccino, there’s something magical about that first sip. Every time I walk in and glance at the menu, I wonder, “There are so many beverages under different categories—what’s really inside them?”

I’m a Data Science Graduate, and being naturally curious (and caffeine-dependent!), I’ve always wanted to dive deeper into the contents of these drinks. How much sugar is really in that refreshing iced tea? Which drinks pack the most protein or fat? How does caffeine vary across categories?

This project was born from that curiosity. I wanted to analyze the nutritional content of Starbucks beverages across different categories and extract meaningful insights that could help not just coffee lovers, but anyone who enjoys a Starbucks stop, make more informed choices.

***Why This Project?***

The motivation behind this project is simple: beverages are more than just delicious drinks; they’re full of nutrients (both good and bad) that can affect our daily intake. As a data scientist, I wanted to break down this information into easy-to-understand insights.

**What are the most calorie-dense drinks?**

**Which beverages are packed with sugar?**

**How does caffeine content vary across categories?**

These are the questions I sought to answer, and through this project, we dive into the data to uncover the nutritional realities of our favorite Starbucks drinks.

**Conclusion:**

This project provided deep insights into the nutritional landscape of Starbucks beverages. For those who love their coffee or enjoy a sugary treat, understanding what’s in your favorite drink can help you make choices that align with your dietary preferences—whether you’re looking for low-calorie, high-protein, or just trying to keep your sugar intake in check.

I hope this project serves as a useful guide for all coffee enthusiasts and health-conscious consumers alike. Thanks for stopping by my GitHub, and feel free to explore the project files!
